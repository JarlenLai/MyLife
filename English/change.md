                                Try somethings new for 30 days
    A few years ago, I felt like I was stuck in a rut, so I decided to follow in the footsteps of the great American philosopher, Morgan Spurlock, and I try somethings new for 30 days.
    几年前， 我感觉对老一套感到枯燥乏味，所以我决定追随伟大的美国哲学家摩根·斯普尔洛克的脚步，尝试做新的事情30天
    This idea is actually pretty simple. Think about somethings you have always wanted to add to your life and try it for the next 30 days. It turns out 30 days is just about the right amount of time to add a new habit or subtract a habit--like watching the new(early to bed and early to rise, reading, exercise,etc)--from your life.
    这个想法非常的简单。考虑一下，你常想在你生命中做的一些事情接下来30天尝试做这些。这就是，30天刚好是这么一段合适的时间去养成一个新的习惯或者改掉一个习惯--例如看新闻（早睡早起，阅读，运动等等）--在你的生活中。
    There's a few things I learned while doing these 30-days challenges. The first was, instead of the months flying by, forgotten, the time was much more memorable. This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a month.
    当我在这30天做这些挑战的事情时，我学到以下一些事。第一件事是，取代了飞逝而过易被遗忘的岁月的是这段时间非常的更加令人难忘。挑战的一部分是要一个月内每天我要去拍摄一张照片。
    And I remember exactly where I was and what I was donig that day. I also noticed that as I started to do more and harder 30-day challenges, myself-confidence grew. I went from desk-dwelling computer nerd to the kind of guy who bikes to work. For fun!
    我清楚的记得那一天我在哪里我在做什么。我也注意到随着我做更多，更难的30天里具有挑战性的事情时，我的自信心也增强了。我从一个台式计算机宅男极客变成了一个爱骑自行车去工作的人--为了玩乐。
    Even last year, I ended up hiking up Mt Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa. I would never have been that adventurous before I stared my 30-day challenges.
    甚至去年，我完成了在非洲最高山峰乞力马扎罗山的远足。在我开始这30天的做挑战性的事情之前我从来没有这样爱冒险过
    I also figured out that if you really want somethings badly enough, you can do anything for 30 days. Have you ever wanted to write a novel? Every November, ten of thousands of people try to write their own 50,000-word novel, from scratch, in 30 days. It turns out, all you have to do is write 1,667 words a day for a month. So I did.
    我也认识到如果你真想一些糟糕透顶的事，你可以在30天里面做这些事。你曾经想写小说吗？每年11月，数以万计的人们在30天里，从零起点尝试写他们自己的5万字小说。这结果就是， 你所要去做的事情就是每天写1667个字写一个月。所以我做到了。
    By the way, the secret is not to go to sleep until you have written you words for the day. You might be sleep-deprived, but you will finish your novel. Now is my book the next great American nvoel? No. I wrote it in a month. It's awful.
    顺便说一下，秘密是除非在一天里你已经写完了1667个字，要不你就甭想睡觉。你可能被剥夺睡眠，但你将会完成你的小说。那么我写的书会是下一部伟大的美国小说吗？不是的。我在一个月内写完它。它看上去太可怕了。
    But for the rest of my life, if I meet John Hodgman at a TED party, I don't have to say, "I'm a computer scientist." No, no, if I want to, I can say, "I'm a novelist."
    但是在我的余生，如果我在一个TED聚会上遇见约翰·霍奇曼，我不必开口说，“我是一个电脑科学家。”不，不会的， 如果我想我可以说， “我是一个小说家。”
    So here's one last thing I'd like to mention. I learned that when I make small, sustainable changes, things I could keep doing, they were more likely to stick. There's nothing wrong with big, crazy challenges. In fact, they're a ton of fun. But they're less likely to stick. When I gave up sugar for 30 days, day 31 I looker like this.
    我这儿想提的最后一件事情。当我做这些小的，持续性的变化，我可以不断尝试做的事情时，我学到我可以把他们变得更加容易坚持做下来。这和又大又疯狂的具有挑战性的事情无关。事实上，他们的乐趣无穷。但是，他们就是不太可能坚持做下来。（比如）当我在30天里拒绝吃糖果，31天后看上去就像这样。
    So here's my quesiton to you: What are you waiting for? I guarantee you the next 30 days are going to pass whether you like it or not, so why not think about somethings you have always wanted to try and give it a shot! For the next 30 days.
    所以我给大家提的问题是：大家还在等什么？我保证大家会在未来的30天去经历你喜欢或者不喜欢的事，那么为什么不考虑一些你经常想去尝试并在未来30天里试试给自己一个机会。
